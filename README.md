# Paging

Build a paging component.
Whenever you click a load moore button - an AJAX request should be sent to the Star Wars API.
Request URL for the first request is <https://swapi.dev/api/people/>
Any other API can be used as long as it returns an array of items and url for next request.
Items should be added with animation.
